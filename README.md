Hospital Patient Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and the corresponding dataset used for deep-dive analysis of hospital patient data from Nomula's Hospital. The project is designed to help healthcare professionals and administrators better understand patient demographics, treatment outcomes, resource utilization, and key operational metrics.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI for visualizing, exploring, and generating insights from hospital patient records. The dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions by analyzing trends in admissions, costs, patient satisfaction, recovery outcomes, and more.

Dashboard Features
Condition by Total Cost: Visualization of total costs incurred by different medical conditions, helping identify costliest treatments.

Admissions Analysis: Breakdown of patient admissions by year, state, and medical condition for resource planning.

Length of Stay Trends: Tracking how the average length of hospital stay varies by year of admission.

Readmission Analytics: Identification of readmission rates split by gender and by month, aiding patient care improvements.

Medication Outcome Analysis: Proportion of patients recovered or stable after treatment.

Patient Satisfaction: Average patient age segmented by satisfaction scores.

Cost and Demographic Correlations: Scatter and categorical analysis to find relationships between patient age, condition, and costs.

Geographical Distribution: Map view of patient admissions by Indian state, highlighting regional healthcare needs.
